        <p>Today we worked on creating apps with cookies</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Homework</h2>
          <p>For next week we'll keep working with counters. Watch and type along with the video below. I've included some notes to help you along the way.</p>

          <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/111071622" width="700" height="440" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p>We can use <strong>counters</strong> to keep track of information in web apps. A counter is just a variable that holds a changing number. We usually start counters off at 0:</p>

          <pre class="prettyprint">
counter = 0</pre>

          <p>We called the variable <code>counter</code>, but we could have called it anything. We can add 1 to the counter by using this syntax:</p>

          <pre class="prettyprint">
counter = counter + 1</pre>

          <p>It might seem weird, but the above line is just saying "Take what's in counter, add 1 to it, then save the result back into counter.</p>

          <p>We can use the same basic syntax inside of a rails app. Suppose we were using a cookie to keep track of numbers coming from the params hash:</p>

          <pre class="prettyprint">
cookies["counter"] = cookies["counter"].to_f + params["number"].to_f</pre>

          <p>We just substitued the cookie for the variable and converted the params hash value into a number. This won't work if <code>cookies["counter"]</code> doesn't exist yet, though. We need to make sure the we just set it to <code>params["number"].to_f</code> then:</p>

          <pre class="prettyprint">
if cookies["counter"]
  cookies["counter"] = cookies["counter"].to_f + params["number"].to_f
else
  cookies["counter"] = params["number"].to_f
end</pre>

          <p>Also be ready to talk about the following questions:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>What is a counter?</li>
            <li>Why to we need to add <code>.to_f</code> in the Rails counter?</li>
            <li>Can you think of any ways to use counters in your apps?</li>
            <li>Did you get stuck anywhere?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please email me if you get stuck for more than 10 minutes, and make sure you're able to build the app from the video before our next class.</p>
