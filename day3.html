        <h1>Day 3</h1>
        <p>Today we reviewed Bootstrap, learned about forms and started building our first Rails app in Nitrous.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Forms and setting up Nitrous</h2>

          <h3>notes</h3>
          <p>Here is an example form:</p>
          <pre class="">
<form action="#">
  <label for="first_name">First name:</label>
  <input id="first_name" name="first_name" type="text"><br>
  <input type="submit">
</form></pre>
        <p>Input fields are places where the user can interact with the form. In this case, the input is a text field. Other input fields include radio buttons, checkboxes and dropdowns. Labels describe the purpose of a particular input field.</p>
        <p>We can connect labels with inputs by matching up the <code>for</code> attribute on a label and the <code>id</code> attribute on an input. They need to be spelled exactly the same to properly connect.</p>

        <h4>Starting a new Rails app</h4>
        <p>Use this command to create a Rails app:</p>
        <pre>
rails new my_app</pre>
        <p>where <code>my_app</code> is your app's name.</p>
        <p>Then, you need to enter the directory in terminal (the black box at the bottom of the screen). <code>cd</code> stands for "change directory"</p>
        <pre>
cd my_app</pre>
        <p>If you want to go back to the home directory, you can just use the command <code>cd</code> by itself.</p>
        <h4>Running a Rails app</h4>
        <p>Once you're inside your app's folder, you can use this command to start your rails server:</p>
        <pre>
rails server</pre>
        <p>Then, click on "preview" in the top menu and select port 3000</p>
        <h4>Creating a route</h4>
        <p>All routes are stored in the routes file, which you can find at config > routes.rb</p>
        <p>A route looks like this:</p>
        <pre>
get "/my_form" => "application#form"</pre>
        <p>There are a few pieces to it. <code>"/myform"</code> is the URL that the user types in the address bar to access this route. <code>application</code> is the controller name. We'll keep this the same for now. <code>form</code> is the action name. It can be named whatever you want, but the action name should match up with an HTML file in the application folder.</p>
        <h4>Creating an HTML page</h4>
        <p>Web pages in Rails apps are called views. We can find them in app > views</p>
        <p>First, we need to create a folder called <code>application</code> inside the views folder. This folder name needs to match up with the controller name from the route</p>
        <p>Next, we need to create an HTML file called <code>form.html</code> inside the application folder. This filename needs to match up with the action name from the route.</p>
        <p>Now, just write normal HTML code inside the file. Don't worry about the body or head elements - we'll talk about those later.</p>
        <h2>Homework</h2>
        <p>Estimated time: < 15 min</p>
        <p>Today's homework is pretty short. All you need to do is create a completely new Rails app (that means you can't use what we built in class) and add an HTML page that contains a form. The form can be for anything you choose. You should be able to enter a URL into the address bar and see the page with the form.</p>
